# Peacock-Technologies

A website for a friend of mine from high school who owns his own business. He gave me a brief outline of what he wanted, I tried to implement some responsive design elements.  I also attempted to put a Contact Us form with jQuery.


Custom CSS Classes

The class(es) I created are:

1. .content 
        what class does: changes the backgroung color to a beautiful shade of blue and sets the margins to auto

2.  #home-audio-systems, 
    #home-theater-systems,
    #television-installation,
    #phone-and-network-systems
        what class does: makes it so that every other service has a background color of pink that contrasts with the blue background very nicely

3.  h1,
    h3,
    p
        what class does: makes it so that all the text on the services.html are aligned in the center

The js function I used was simply to make the peacock logo be hidden once clicked on
